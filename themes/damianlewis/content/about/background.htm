<p>I started my career working for the BBC as Graphic Designer specialising in the production of 3D animations and the creation of multimedia elements. Having mastered these skills I moved into area of Interactive Design creating user interfaces for various CD-ROM applications and websites for both the BBC and Open University. Here I learnt how to work within a development team to provide the digital assets required by a project whilst also collaborating with producers and academics to assure the project met the requirements of the brief.</p>

<p>Following 5 years at the BBC I decided to take what I had learnt and start to work freelance in the area of interactive design and development. I specialised in the production of interactive websites and resources from initial concepts and prototypes to final product using both Adobe Flash/ActionScript and HTML/CSS/JavaScript platforms. Working directly with clients I was able to deliver bespoke design solutions and interactive applications for a wide variety of industries, ranging from educational institutions to financial organisations.</p>

<p>As my passion for web development technologies has grown I have become increasingly more focused on both frontend and backend development, specialising in the development of PHP based systems using object-oriented design and agile methodologies to produce clean, maintainable code that provides the tools needed by clients to deliver their services.</p>

<p>I am highly adaptable and driven by learning. I have built up a long list of skills over the many years working as a web professional which allows me to offer a complete online solution to businesses or cater to larger organisation that require specific services. My main strength is in the way I can turn my hand to pretty much any tool, language or system in both backend and frontend development. I thrive on the challenge of taking on something new and delivering to a high standard.</p>
